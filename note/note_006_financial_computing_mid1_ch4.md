```r

# observed time serive Y with length t
# Y = c(Y1, Y2, Y3, ... Yt)

# strictly stationary is
# joint probability density function is identical
# pdf(Y1, Y2, Y3, ... Yt+1) = pdf(Ya, Ya+1, ... Ya+t)
# if {Yt} is strictly stationary, {Y^2_t) is also strictly stationary

# since strictly stationary is so strict
# we use covariance(weakly) stationary for alternative
# if {Yt} is weakly stationary
# E(Yt) = constant mu
# var(Yt) = constant variance
# cov(Yt, Y_t-k) is only correlate to time log k

# simple time series model
# MA(q) model
